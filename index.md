## Welcome to the Freaking Museum

This site was initially inspired by my _見山不是山的日常_ series on Facebook. 
I will implement some of those and do write-ups on this website. Feel free to watch how they are done!

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/y2mk1ng/Freaking-Museum/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
